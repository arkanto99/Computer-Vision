# Computer Vision Project

Projects of the subject Computer Vision at the University of Granada (UGR). Course 2021/2022

## Contents

### [Assignment 0](https://github.com/arkanto99/VisionPorComputador/tree/main/P0)
Image reading with OpenCV, Numpy and MatPlotLib.

### [Assignment 1](https://github.com/arkanto99/VisionPorComputador/tree/main/P1)
Manual implementation of different tools used in Computer Vision:
+ Approximation of Gaussian mask and its 1st and 2nd derivative masks.
+ Convolution using separable masks.
+ Construction of Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids.

In addition, two applications of the above are added:
+ Reconstruction of an image from its Laplacian pyramid.
+ Creation of hybrid images (greyscale and colour).

### [Assignment 2](https://github.com/arkanto99/VisionPorComputador/tree/main/P2)
+ Implementation of the SIFT algorithm for characteristic points detection
+ Construction of panoramas using Homographs

### [Assignment 3](https://github.com/arkanto99/VisionPorComputador/tree/main/P3)
Use of convolutional neural networks.

### [Final Proyect](https://github.com/arkanto99/VisionPorComputador/tree/main/Proyecto)
Use of the ResNet50 model to perform Transfer Learning
(using such a network previously trained on ImageNet) in order to assist in the diagnosis of pulmonary pneumonias in X-ray images. Other different models are also tested to discern which one provides the best results for this problem.
